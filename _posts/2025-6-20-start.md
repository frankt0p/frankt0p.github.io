title: "A new start to build my website!"

Today I tried editing my personal homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Until now, I had only experimented with creating it, but today I truly learned how to build a website and understood the purpose and usage of various HTML tags.   
GitHub provides Jekyll so I can use existing templates and edit pages directly with Markdown, but I still wanted to write the entire page structure myself. Although it’s not very beautiful yet, I believe that through my studies I will be able to create a perfect personal website. This is my first blog post.  
今天我尝试了使用html+css+js的方法来编辑我的个人主页，之前只是试着进行了创建，而今天则真正的了解了一下如何进行网页构建，html中各标签的作用与使用方法。github提供了jeckll以让我能够使用已有的网页格式并使用md来直接进行网页编辑，但我还是想要自己来写一下整个网页的格式，现在虽然不是很美观，但相信通过我的学习可以做出一个完美的个人网页。
